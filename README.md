# hubot-scripts
Some scripts for hubot as well as an accompanying appengine project which can be used to add new functionality for hubot including being a stock market simulator.

## Installation
All the javascript files in `hubot-scripts` can be copied over to the `scripts` folder of your hubot installation.  You will need to make a `config.js` file using the `config.template.js` file as boilerplate.

The appengine project can be deployed as is, you just have to create a new project on appengine and deploy it using gcloud.

Make sure you update the config file for the hubot-scripts with the URL for the appengine project!
